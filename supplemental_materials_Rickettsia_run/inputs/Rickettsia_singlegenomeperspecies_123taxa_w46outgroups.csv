Isolate passaged 9 times in embyonated chicken eggs, 6 Vero E6 tissue culture passages, and pooled from 1-3 passages in mouse L929 cells.  Organism was purified from host cells by differential centrifugation and banding In Renografin density gradients and WNA was purified with Qiagen spin columns.Rickettsia. This genus, like other Rickettsial organisms such as Neorickettsia and Anaplasma, is composed of obligate intracellular bacteria. There are two groups, the spotted fever group, and the typhus group. The latter is composed of two organisms, Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi. The bacteria can be transmitted via an arthropod (tick, fleas, mites, and/or lice) to a host organism or maintained transstadially and transovarially in the arthropod.  When pathogenic in humans,  they target endothelial cells and sometimes macrophages. They attach via an adhesin, rickettsial outer membrane proteins A and/or B, and are internalized where they persist as cytoplasmically free organisms. Rickettsia typhi. This organism causes murine (endemic) typhus and is an obligate intracellular pathogen that infects both the flea vector and hosts such as humans, commonly  rats, and some other mammals. It is in the typhus group along with R. prowazekii, and genomic comparisons demonstrate colinearity and similarity to the genome of that organism except for two independent inversions near the origin and terminus. In the flea vector, the bacterium penetrates the gut epithelial barrier and is found in the feces which become infective. Rickettsia typhi strain TH1527. This is the first strain isolated in Thailand from a human case of murine typhus. ","2014-12-08T22:12:44.531Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

It will include all the neglected metazoan parasites. Preliminary illumina sequencing from these helminth species will be used to produce draft genomic assemblies which will create a unique genomic resource. Draft assemblies of the genomes will underpin research and progress into these neglected diseases. Gene and protein predictions will provide a resource that can be mined by researchers for diagnostic markers, new drug targets or vaccines. Comparing the genomes will yield evolutionary insights and will enable more to be learnt about the genomic basis for the huge differences in the biology of these parasites and the diseases they cause.","2014-12-08T22:43:35.442Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

Both rOmpA and rOmpB are conserved throughout spotted fever group rickettsiae as members of a family of autotransporter proteins. Previously, it was demonstrated that rOmpB is proteolytically processed with the cleavage site residing near the autotransporter domain at the carboxy-terminal end of the protein, cleaving the 168 kDa precursor into apparent 120 kDa and 32 kDa fragments. The 120 and 32 kDa fragments remain non-covalently associated on the surface of the bacterium with implications that the 32kDa fragment functions as the membrane anchor domain. Here we present evidence for a similar post-translational processing of rOmpA. rOmpA is expressed as a predicted 224 kDa precursor yet is observed on SDS-PAGE as a 190 kDa protein. A small rOmpA fragment of ~32kDa was discovered during surface proteome analysis and identified as the carboxy terminal end of the protein. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated to the autotransporter region of rOmpA and confirmed a 32kDa fragment corresponding to the calculated mass of a proteolytically cleaved rOmpA autotransporter region. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed a cleavage site on the carboxy-terminal side of Ser-1958 in rOmpA. An avirulent strain of R. rickettsii Iowa deficient in rOmpB processing was also defective in processing of rOmpA. The similarities of the cleavage sites and failure of R. rickettsii Iowa to process either rOmpA or rOmpB suggest a single enzyme may be responsible for both processing events.","2017-03-20T02:32:55.734Z","2017-03-20T02:32:55.734Z"
