Worm infections account for morbidity equivalent to more than 100 million disability adjusted life years from more than one billion infections globally. The 50 Helminth Genomes Initiative is collaborative project that aims to survey the genomes of nematodes and platyhelminths that are either of medical or veterinary importance, or as used as models for those. It will include all the neglected metazoan parasites. Preliminary illumina sequencing from these helminth species will be used to produce draft genomic assemblies which will create a unique genomic resource. Draft assemblies of the genomes will underpin research and progress into these neglected diseases. Gene and protein predictions will provide a resource that can be mined by researchers for diagnostic markers, new drug targets or vaccines. Comparing the genomes will yield evolutionary insights and will enable more to be learnt about the genomic basis for the huge differences in the biology of these parasites and the diseases they cause.","2014-12-08T22:43:35.442Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

The impact(s) of the bacterial passenger/infection on the flukes has not been thoroughly explored, but may be benign or neutral. These rickettsia-like microbes can cause severe disease if transferred horizontally to monocytes and macrophages of the mammalian hosts of the trematodes. Neorickettsial illnesses, including salmon poisoning of dogs, Potomac horse fever, Sennetsu fever, etc., are known to impact wild and domestic animals as well as humans.This apparently novel species/strain of Neorickettsia was identified during the whole genome sequencing of Fasciola hepatica (JXXN00000000). Note that the physical sample for this Neorickettsial endosymbiont BioSample (SAMN04272095) is the same physical sample as that of the host Fasciola hepatica BioSample (SAMN02780903).","2016-04-27T17:12:33.788Z","2016-04-27T17:12:33.788Z"

This strain was isolated in mice from an infected tick. The most significant difference between the genome of E. ruminantium and those of the other Rickettsiales is the presence of a large number of repetitive sequences. These repeats make up 8.5% of the genome and consist of simple sequence repeats (SSRs), large tandem repeats, and dispersed repeats. These repeats are associated with 29 of the 32 pseudogenes which appear to have occured primarily through duplication events. In addition, it is thought that the SSRs may play a role in regulation or phase variation. Between 10-15% of the genes in free-living bacteria are thought to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Intracellular bacteria have limited exposure to other bacteria and therefore a smaller portion of their genome is from other organisms. It is estimated that only 3% of the genome of E. ruminantium has been obtained by gene transfer. The existence of a large number of repeat elements may be a alternative strategy for increasing genetic diversity and improve the evolutionary fitness of E. ruminantium.","2014-12-08T22:11:10.071Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

In this project, we sequenced the genome of an Aedes aegypti Wolbachia transinfection that had been established 15 years prior by transferring the Wolbachia strain wAlbB from its native host, Aedes albopictus, to Ae. aegypti. We then used backcrossing to assess the effects of the Wolbachia strain on host-fitness, and its maternal transmission and stability, in two different Ae. aegypti nuclear backgrounds, originating from Australia and Malaysia.","2021-08-26T17:47:06.424Z","2021-08-26T17:47:06.424Z"
