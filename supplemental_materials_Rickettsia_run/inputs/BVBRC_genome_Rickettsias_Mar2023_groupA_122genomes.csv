Patient diagnosed with bronchitis, fever of unknown origin, and no rash.  Isolate passaged 9 times in embyonated chicken eggs, 6 Vero E6 tissue culture passages, and pooled from 1-3 passages in mouse L929 cells.  Organism was purified from host cells by differential centrifugation and banding In Renografin density gradients and WNA was purified with Qiagen spin columns.Rickettsia. This genus, like other Rickettsial organisms such as Neorickettsia and Anaplasma, is composed of obligate intracellular bacteria. There are two groups, the spotted fever group, and the typhus group. The latter is composed of two organisms, Rickettsia prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi. The bacteria can be transmitted via an arthropod (tick, fleas, mites, and/or lice) to a host organism or maintained transstadially and transovarially in the arthropod.  When pathogenic in humans,  they target endothelial cells and sometimes macrophages. They attach via an adhesin, rickettsial outer membrane proteins A and/or B, and are internalized where they persist as cytoplasmically free organisms. Rickettsia typhi. This organism causes murine (endemic) typhus and is an obligate intracellular pathogen that infects both the flea vector and hosts such as humans, commonly  rats, and some other mammals. It is in the typhus group along with R. prowazekii, and genomic comparisons demonstrate colinearity and similarity to the genome of that organism except for two independent inversions near the origin and terminus. In the flea vector, the bacterium penetrates the gut epithelial barrier and is found in the feces which become infective. Rickettsia typhi strain TH1527. This is the first strain isolated in Thailand from a human case of murine typhus. ","2014-12-08T22:12:44.531Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

In the last 25 years we have recognised that many Rickettsia are arthropod symbionts, and sit alongside a sister taxon, Ca. Megaira, which are symbiotic associates of microeukaryotes. The lack of genomic information for symbiotic strains affects our ability to determine the evolutionary relationships between strains and understand the biological underpinnings of the different symbioses. We clarify these relationships by assembling 26 genomes of Rickettsia from understudied groups, and the first two Ca. Megaira, from various insects and microeukaryotes. Of note, the accessory genome diversity and broad host range of Torix Rickettsia parallels all other Rickettsia combined. This diversity, alongside the breadth of host species, make the Torix clade an important hidden player in invertebrate biology and physiology. We argue this clade should be given its own genus status, for which we propose Ca. Tisiphia.","2021-10-31T11:22:01.265Z","2021-10-31T11:22:01.265Z"

The genome of Rickettsia felis strain URRWXCa12 (strain California 2) reveals some unusual features. There are two plasmids (pRF and pRFdelta), the first such identified in the Rickettsia genus, and the pRF plasmid has genes that encode proteins similar to those found on conjugative plasmids such as TraA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, F plasmid TraD and TraG, and the chromosome encodes proteins similar to the vir genes of A. tumefaciens. The chromosome encodes a protein that is similar to the IncP plasmid primase protein TraC. All of these functions may be involved in pathogenesis and the movement of proteins and DNA and electron microscopy confirmed the evidence of a conjugative pilus in this organism as well as other fimbriae.The genome exhibited a large number of repetitive elements, including 82 transposase genes, and genomic comparisons with other Rickettsia indicates a large number of inversions and translocations. These were many Rickettsia palindromic elements (RPEs) found in the genome as well as a large number of surface antigen (sca) genes including split genes that were shown to be transcribed, and genes encoding tricoriticopeptide repeat proteins (TPR) and ankyrin-repeat proteins, both of which may be involved in infection processes. Many global metabolic regulators were also discovered, including fourteen spoT paralogs that regulate cellular metabolism in Escherichia coli in response to starvation conditions and all fourteen were found to be transcribed. Sixteen toxin and fourteen anti-toxin genes were discovered that potentially may be involved in maintaining the presence of the bacteria in the host; possibly by targeting the host cell or in synchronizing the bacterial replication cycles.","2014-12-08T22:12:44.145Z","2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

Both rOmpA and rOmpB are conserved throughout spotted fever group rickettsiae as members of a family of autotransporter proteins. Previously, it was demonstrated that rOmpB is proteolytically processed with the cleavage site residing near the autotransporter domain at the carboxy-terminal end of the protein, cleaving the 168 kDa precursor into apparent 120 kDa and 32 kDa fragments. The 120 and 32 kDa fragments remain non-covalently associated on the surface of the bacterium with implications that the 32kDa fragment functions as the membrane anchor domain. Here we present evidence for a similar post-translational processing of rOmpA. rOmpA is expressed as a predicted 224 kDa precursor yet is observed on SDS-PAGE as a 190 kDa protein. A small rOmpA fragment of ~32kDa was discovered during surface proteome analysis and identified as the carboxy terminal end of the protein. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated to the autotransporter region of rOmpA and confirmed a 32kDa fragment corresponding to the calculated mass of a proteolytically cleaved rOmpA autotransporter region. N-terminal amino acid sequencing revealed a cleavage site on the carboxy-terminal side of Ser-1958 in rOmpA. An avirulent strain of R. rickettsii Iowa deficient in rOmpB processing was also defective in processing of rOmpA. The similarities of the cleavage sites and failure of R. rickettsii Iowa to process either rOmpA or rOmpB suggest a single enzyme may be responsible for both processing events.","2017-01-22T00:23:09.192Z","2017-01-22T00:23:09.192Z"

Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) portable MinION sequencer overcomes many of these challenges to allow small scale sequencing projects with minimal laboratory and computing infrastructure. We performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Rickettsia typhi, an important and neglected cause of fever across much of the tropics and subtropics. Sequencing libraries were prepared from extracted DNA following standard ONT protocols and sequenced on a laptop in our laboratory in Vientiane, Laos. Basecalling was performed subsequently using ONT's Albacore software and assembled locally using a bioinformatics pipeline. This generated a single contig assembly of 1,078,916bp. Frequent SNP and indel error rates, commonly seen with ONT sequencing data, resulted in multiple gene annotation errors. As a result, DNA was also sequenced in the United Kingdom using the Illumina platform to generate a polished genome. Only 3 previous R. typhi whole genome sequences exist. Comparison with these shows evidence of reductive genome evolution with no rearrangements and few differences between strains collected over a 90-year time period. This is the first WGS to be performed in Laos and the first WGS of an R. typhi sample collected in the last 50 years. We demonstrate the utility of portable sequencing platforms such as the MinION for carrying out next-generation sequencing projects in resource-limited settings.","2018-11-30T03:52:35.374Z","2018-11-30T03:52:35.374Z"
